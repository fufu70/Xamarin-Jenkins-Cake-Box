Welcome to the Jenkins [Dump Cake mix](https://media.giphy.com/media/AFTt9NqrWfKuY/giphy.gif), where all of your Analysis is at a one stop shop.

## The requirements

You thought that was a Download And Analyze (DAA) project, **but** you are mistaken! To run the PHP: HP: HP: HP-Jenkins-Breakfast-Box we need to install dependencies:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * Make sure to download the latest version, even if you already installed VirtualBox before.
  * As of writing this my version (AOWTMV) is 5.1.14
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * AOWTMV is 1.8.6
